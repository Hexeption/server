# Puffle Server

**Puffle** is a next-gen [Yukon](https://github.com/wizguin/yukon-server/)-inspired "*any game*" private server.

## 🃏 Features

- **TypeScript**: Uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript, getting all the benefits of the language.
- **Validation**: Strong validation of all user input thanks to [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/).
- **Multi-threaded**: Each world/server runs in its own node.js process efficiently.
- **Cache Manager**: Various ways of storing the cache (like [Redis](https://redis.io/)).
- **ORM**: Thanks to [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), it is possible to use several types of databases.
- **Fastify**: Uses the high-performance [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as a web server.
- **Configurable**: Highly configurable through the use of JSON-based config files.
